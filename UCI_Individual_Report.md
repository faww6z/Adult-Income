**Fawwaz Ibrahim – Individual Project Report**

Challenges Faced During the Project:

- **Incomplete Participation by a Group Member**

One of my major challenges was the lack of contribution from Yandav, who was supposed to assist with the Introduction and Conclusion sections but provided no input or feedback. This caused delays in finalizing our report structure.

- **Ensuring Cohesion Across Sections**

Because everyone worked on different pieces, I had to spend extra time ensuring the report’s introduction, conclusion, and recommendations flowed coherently with the analysis sections.

- **Maintaining Consistent Formatting**

Combining various writing and coding styles from multiple members into a single cohesive R Markdown and final document required careful review and editing.

**Personal Reflection**

While the project was successful overall, it was frustrating to handle tasks originally assigned to someone else. However, the experience improved my understanding of R Markdown workflows, large dataset handling, and the importance of effective team communication. Despite these challenges, I believe our final report effectively demonstrates that both education and gender strongly influence income levels in this dataset.
