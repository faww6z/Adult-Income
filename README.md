# Income Inequality Analysis

This group project was completed as part of **STAT 1500: Introduction to Data Science (Winter 2025)**.  
We analyzed the UCI Adult Income dataset to explore how education and gender influence income levels using R.

## ðŸ“Š Project Highlights

- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaned missing values, recoded categorical variables, and removed incomplete rows.
- **EDA**: Explored how education and gender affect income distribution through visualizations.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Applied logistic regression, decision trees, linear regression, and two-sample t-tests.
- **Tools Used**: R, RMarkdown, ggplot2, caret, dplyr

## ðŸ—ƒ Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Adult Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)
- **Size**: Originally 48,842 rows Ã— 15 columns; reduced to ~30,000 rows after cleaning.
- **Target Variable**: `Income` (binary: >$50K or â‰¤$50K)
